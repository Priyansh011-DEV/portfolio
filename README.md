# Simple Portfolio Template

Files:
- index.html  — main page, edit text here.
- styles.css  — styles for colors, layout.
- script.js   — tiny javascript (smooth scroll).
- README.md   — this file.

## How to use (kid-friendly, step-by-step)
1. Download the zip file and unzip it on your computer.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to see the site locally.
3. Edit `index.html` with a text editor (Notepad, VS Code, or GitHub web editor).
   - Change "Your Name" to your real name.
   - Edit the About text and Project titles.
4. To publish on the web for free, create a GitHub account (github.com).
5. Create a new repository (choose a name, e.g. `portfolio`).
6. Upload the files (use "Add file → Upload files" on GitHub).
7. In your repo: go to Settings → Pages, choose "main" branch and root `/`, save.
8. After a minute, your site will be live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`

If you want me to change colors, add a section, or edit the text, tell me what to change and I'll update the files for you.
